'''
As we have seen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets.

When to use a dictionary:
- When you need a logical association between a key:value pair.
- When you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom key.
- When your data is being constantly modified. Remember, dictionaries are mutable.

When to use the other types:
- Use lists if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently.
- Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements.
- Use tuples when your data cannot change.
