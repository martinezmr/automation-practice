Key Takeaways
- NumPy can manipulate data using various array shape manipulation techniques
- SciPy has built-in packages that help in handling the scientific domains
- Matplotlib is a visualization tool that uses a low-level graph plotting library built in python
- Scikit is a powerful and modern machine learning Python library for fully and semi-automated data analysis and information extraction
- Pandas can load and export data in a variety of formats


Numpy
- used for mathematical computation
- used for arrays
    - shape manipulation
        - split (.hsplit) - splits the array in two
        - flatten (.ravel) - flattens the dataset into one array
        - resize (.resize) - resizes the array to its original 
        - reshape (.reshape) - changes or reshapes the dataset 
        - stack (.hstack) - stacks arrays together
- universal functions
    - sqrt - provides the square root of every element in the array
    - cos - provides the cosine value for all elements in the array
    - exp - performs exponentiation on each element
    - floor - returns the largest integer value of every element in the array


Pandas
- used for data manipulation
    - intrinsic data alignment
    - data operations functions
    - functions for handling missing data
    - data standardization functions
    - data structure handling major use cases
- four main libraries
    - series - one dimensional labeled array
    - data frame - two dimensional array (ex. SQL database structure)
    - three panel - three dimensional array
    - panel (4D) - four dimensional array (experimental)

matploblib
- multiplatform data visualization tool
- full control over graph or line plots
